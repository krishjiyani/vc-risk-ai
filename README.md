# 🚀 Startup Growth Classifier (Big/Small) – Internship ML Project

This project involves building a machine learning model that classifies startups as either **"Big"** or **"Small"** based on various growth metrics and financial indicators. It was developed as part of an ongoing internship and focuses on using data-driven methods to support investment and scaling decisions.
